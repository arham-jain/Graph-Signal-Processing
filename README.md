# Graph-Signal-Processing

An analytic tool to automate preprocessing and analysis using Graph Signal Processing. The project is written in Python, it is recommended to replicate the environment by creating a virtual environment. On creation, all the dependencies need to be installed from the requirements.txt.

##Creating Virtual Environment

Python 3 already ships virtualenv. But if itâ€™s not installed in your environment for some reason, you can install it via the package for your operating systems, otherwise you can install from pip:

```pip install virtualenv```

You can create and activate a virtualenv by:
```
# virtualenv is shipped in Python 3.6+ as venv instead of pyvenv.
# See https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/venv.html
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

On windows the syntax for activating it is a bit different:

```venv\Scripts\activate```

Once you activated your virtualenv everything you are doing is confined inside the virtualenv. To exit a virtualenv just type deactivate.

##Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated. Use the following command to download all the python dependencies

```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
